# Current Progress and Next Steps

## Current Status
- Built LLM server container with PyTorch and CUDA support
- Container successfully builds but has GPU access issues
- System has 4x NVIDIA A2 GPUs with CUDA 12.8 and Driver Version 570.86.15

## Current Issues
- CUDA driver version mismatch (container uses 12.1.0, host has 12.8)
- Container cannot access GPUs properly
- `nvidia-smi` not working in container
- CUDA initialization failing with error 803

## Next Steps
1. Update Dockerfile:
   - Change base image to `nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04`
   - Ensure proper NVIDIA driver integration
   - Add necessary CUDA environment variables

2. Container Configuration:
   - Fix GPU device mapping
   - Configure proper NVIDIA runtime
   - Set up correct CUDA driver paths

3. Testing and Verification:
   - Verify GPU access in container
   - Test CUDA functionality
   - Ensure model loading works
   - Check multi-GPU support

## Files to Modify
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `scripts/start-server.sh`

## Current Environment
- Host OS: Darwin 24.3.0
- CUDA Version: 12.8
- NVIDIA Driver: 570.86.15
- GPUs: 4x NVIDIA A2 (16GB each)
- Container Runtime: Podman
